# FoxIDs .NET Samples

This repository contains .NET samples used in FoxIDs blog posts, demos, and conference talks.
Each sample illustrates a specific scenario for integrating .NET applications or APIs with [FoxIDs](https://www.foxids.com), including OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, SAML 2.0, and passwordless authentication.

The examples are intended as lightweight, easy-to-understand reference implementations that you can copy, run, or adapt for your own projects.
