# AI-Generated ASP.NET Core Passwordless Authentication with FoxIDs (Email OTP)

This sample demonstrates how to authenticate users in an **AI-generated** ASP.NET Core application using [FoxIDs](https://www.foxids.com) with OpenID Connect and passwordless login via one-time codes sent by email.  
The application was generated using AI tooling and then integrated with FoxIDs to showcase how modern development workflows can combine AI-assisted scaffolding with secure identity management.

A full walkthrough and explanation of the AI-generated version is available in the accompanying Medium article:

The project uses a simple Razor Pages structure created by AI, and the same integration approach applies to MVC, Blazor, and other ASP.NET Core frameworks.
