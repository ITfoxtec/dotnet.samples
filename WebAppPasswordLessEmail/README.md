# ASP.NET Core Passwordless Authentication with FoxIDs (Email OTP)

This sample demonstrates how to authenticate users in an ASP.NET Core application using [FoxIDs](https://www.foxids.com) with OpenID Connect and passwordless login via one-time codes sent by email.

The project uses a minimal Razor Pages app, but the same integration applies to MVC, Blazor, and other ASP.NET Core web frameworks.

## Features
