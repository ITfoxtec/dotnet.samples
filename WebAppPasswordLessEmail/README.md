# ASP.NET Core Passwordless Authentication with FoxIDs (Email OTP)

This sample demonstrates how to authenticate users in an ASP.NET Core application using [FoxIDs](https://www.foxids.com) with OpenID Connect and passwordless login via one-time codes sent by email.

A full walkthrough and explanation of this sample is available in the accompanying Medium article:  
**[Passwordless Authentication in ASP.NET Core with FoxIDs and Email-based OTP](https://medium.com/@anders.revsgaard/passwordless-authentication-in-asp-net-core-with-foxids-and-email-based-otp-c8b85c1c80cd)**.

## Features

- Passwordless authentication with email-based OTP
- OpenID Connect integration with FoxIDs
